# Reminder App
We have developed a Java application using the Swing GUI that helps users keep track of their tasks.

## Tutorial
1. download a local repository
2. navigate to the repo in your command line
3. run the start.sh bash script by running the command ./start.sh

## Notes
- if you do not have permission to run the bash script, use the following command: chmod 755 start.sh (and run it again)
- the program takes a while to start up, so please be patient when you first load it up

## Features
- users can create new reminders
- users can edit and delete reminders (note: reminder must be highlighted in the list for the edit and delete buttons to work properly)

## Known Bugs
- a lot
