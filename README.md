# Reminder App
We have developed a Java application using the Swing GUI that helps users keep track of their tasks.

## Tutorial
1. download code to local repo
2. navigate to the repo in your command line
3. run the start.sh bash script by running the command ./start.sh

## Notes
- if you do not have permission to run the bash script, use the following command: chmod 755 start.sh (and run it again)
- the program takes a while to start up, so please be patient when you first load it up

## Features
- users can create new reminders
- users can edit reminders
- users can delete reminders
- users can move reminders up and down to order them in any way they want

## Known Bugs
- Input date field for adding and editing reminders will problems if input is not of the correct format
